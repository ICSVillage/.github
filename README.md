# Welcome to ICS Village's Github!

[ICS Village](https://www.icsvillage.com/) is a registered 501(c)(3) organization.

High profile industrial control system (ICS) security issues have grabbed headlines and sparked change throughout the global supply chain. The ICS Village allows defenders of any experience level to understand the unique failure modes of these systems and how to better prepare and respond to the changing threat landscape.

We bring you real components such as programmable logic controllers (PLC), human-machine interfaces (HMI), remote telemetry units (RTU), and actuators to simulate a realistic environment by using commonly used components throughout different industrial sectors. You will be able to connect your machine to the different industrial components and networks and try to assess these ICS devices with common security scanners to sniff the industrial traffic, and more!
